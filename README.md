About Me

I am Panagiotis Lampros, a cybersecurity enthusiast actively transitioning from a career in accounting and finance into ethical hacking and penetration testing. My goal is to secure the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification by March 2025 and pursue a PhD in Cybersecurity in the United States.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Accounting & Finance from the University of Patras and am currently studying for a Master's Degree in Public Management and e-Governance at the Hellenic Open University. My decision to switch careers was driven by my passion for cybersecurity, problem-solving, and the academic rigor of this field.

    Cloud Security:
